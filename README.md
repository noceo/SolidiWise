# Solidi-Wise

This is a smart-contract application that supports bookkeeping for shared expenses.
To run this app locally you have to do the following steps.

First make sure you have installed the latest `node` and `npm` versions.

Then inside the root of the project directory run:

```
npm install
```

This installs all the needed dependencies for the backend.

Now go inside the frontend directory and run `npm install` again. This installs all the frontend specific dependencies.

To start the local testnet, run:

```
npm run ganache
```


For instructions on starting up the client look into the README file in the frontend directory.
